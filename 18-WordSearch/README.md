So right now I think that my partner Leon and I are done because we arewere using the consolidated way of making one method for all directions since Monday. We just finished the method to fill the board with random letters once the words were placed. What i think needs the most work is the Addword function, the one that returns a boolean. I want it to try multiple times to see if a word can fit over various orientations , but instead it sometimes fits in the same word multiple times. Hopefully that will be fixed by Tuesday morning.
