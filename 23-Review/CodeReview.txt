The glaring issue that I see here is that there is no Driver preset. We were
specifically told to have Driver to access the entire working project, so as of now things wont seem to run fully 
. From what I can tell this is is a take on the turn based game Pokemon against an AI opponent, 
where type such as fire and water play a role in dealing damage as well as the type oof movee such as tackle.

-- BaseChar.java 3
Why not make BaseChar an abstact class? All of the pokemon used in Battle.java ayway are going
to be specific subclasses. I would suggest doing so just to make sure you dont call this by accident.

--BaseChar.java 16
I personally know what PP stands for in the Poke-universe, but it would hurt to add comment
for it because it affects the outcome of every turn. 

--Battle.java 72-86
isnt it better just to initialize the array and acces it right away with a getArray or something?
--Battle.java 67
Its safer to use "else if" when inputting a random integer. It would be trouble otherwise.

--Battle.java 9
Maybe this is incomplete but maybe make it so that Squirtle is the pokemon by default, but that can be changed.

--Fire.java
this can also be an abstract class
